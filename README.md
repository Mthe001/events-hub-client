# 🌟 Local Events Hub

Welcome to **Local Events Hub**, a vibrant platform where communities come together to discover, create, and RSVP to local events—be it meetups, workshops, or small gigs. Built with a modern tech stack, this semi full-stack application combines a dynamic React frontend with a lightweight backend to deliver a seamless user experience.

## 📖 About the Project

**Local Events Hub** is designed to connect people through local happenings. Whether you're a host looking to share your next event or an attendee eager to explore what’s nearby, this app has you covered. It’s a perfect blend of frontend interactivity and backend simplicity, making it an exciting playground for practicing React, Vite, API integration, and more.

- **Discover:** Browse a curated list of local events with filters for date, location, and category.
- **Post:** Create and share your own events with a simple, intuitive form.
- **RSVP:** Let others know you’re attending with a single click.
